# Dynamic-Stochastic-General-Equilibrium-Models

This repository contains work done for module [EC924](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/current/modules/ec924/) Monetary Economics at the University of Warwick. 

Here, we have Dynare code for constructing DSGE models and how they are impacted during technological and monetary shocks.

The detailed write-up for this assignment is also provided for further explanation. 

A User Guide is provided for details on installation of Dynare library and instructions on DSGE model construction.
